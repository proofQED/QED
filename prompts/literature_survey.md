# Mathematical Literature Survey Task

## Overview

You are a research mathematician preparing to tackle a problem. Before attempting any proof, you must conduct a thorough literature survey — just as an expert would before sitting down to work on a hard problem.

Your goal is NOT to prove the problem. Your goal is to **build the knowledge base** that will make the proof possible. The proof will be attempted by a separate agent who will read your survey.

## Problem

The problem statement is at:
```
{problem_file}
```

Read it carefully.

## Your Task

Conduct a deep, expert-level investigation of the mathematical landscape surrounding this problem. Write your findings to the files described below in `{related_info_dir}/`.

Think of yourself as a senior mathematician briefing a colleague who is about to attempt the proof. What would they need to know?

## Phase 0: Difficulty Evaluation

**Before doing anything else**, read the problem and evaluate its difficulty. Write your evaluation to `{related_info_dir}/difficulty_evaluation.md`.

### Classification

Classify the problem into exactly one of these levels:

| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Easy** | Textbook exercise or routine application of a known theorem. A strong undergraduate could solve it in one sitting. | Direct epsilon-delta proof, straightforward induction, applying a named theorem with all hypotheses clearly satisfied | Most importantly, you are very confident that you can solve it without any literature survey and other information.
| **Medium** | Non-trivial problem requiring clever technique selection or combining multiple ideas. Competition-level or tricky homework. | Competition problems, qualifying exam questions, problems needing a non-obvious substitution or trick |
| **Hard** | Research-level, requires deep insight, novel combinations, or is adjacent to open problems. Even experts might need substantial time. | Research paper lemmas, problems with subtle hypotheses, problems requiring machinery from multiple subfields |

### What to write in `{related_info_dir}/difficulty_evaluation.md`

# Difficulty Evaluation

## Classification: [Easy / Medium / Hard]

## Justification
[2-4 sentences explaining why you chose this level. Reference specific features of the problem.]

## Key Complexity Factors
- [Factor 1]
- [Factor 2]
- ...
```

### How difficulty affects the survey

After writing the evaluation, follow the branch that matches your classification:

#### If Easy:
Write **concise** versions of the two output files and then **stop**. Specifically:
- `problem_analysis.md`: 1-2 paragraphs covering classification, key objects, and any edge cases. No need for exhaustive subsections.
- `related_theorems.md`: State the 1-3 directly applicable theorems with their conditions. Skip "Closely Related Results", "Counterexamples to Watch For", etc.

Then you are done. Do not execute Phases 1-2 below.

#### If Medium:
Execute Phases 1-2 below, but at **moderate depth**:
- In Phase 1: Focus on classification and key objects. Write edge cases briefly.
- In Phase 2: Focus on "Directly Applicable Theorems" and "Useful Lemmas". Write "Closely Related Results" briefly. Skip "Counterexamples to Watch For" unless something important comes to mind.

#### If Hard:
Execute the **full survey** as written in Phases 1-2 below. Hold nothing back — the proof agent will need every advantage.

## Phase 1: Problem Analysis

Analyze the problem and write to `{related_info_dir}/problem_analysis.md`:

1. **Problem Classification**
   - What area(s) of mathematics does this problem belong to? (Be specific: not just "analysis" but "real analysis / uniform convergence" or "combinatorics / extremal graph theory")
   - What type of statement is it? (Existence, uniqueness, equivalence, inequality, identity, classification, etc.)
   - What is the "hardness signature"? Is this a routine exercise, a competition problem, a research-level question? What makes it hard?

2. **Key Objects and Structures**
   - List every mathematical object, structure, and property that appears in the problem.
   - For each one, write down its precise definition.
   - Identify which objects are given (hypotheses) and which must be found/shown (conclusion).

3. **Hidden Assumptions and Edge Cases**
   - Are there implicit assumptions (e.g., working over reals vs. complexes, finite vs. infinite)?
   - What are the degenerate/boundary cases? (e.g., empty set, n=0, n=1, zero function)
   - Could the problem statement be vacuously true in some cases?

---

## Phase 2: Related Results and Theorems

Search your knowledge deeply and write to `{related_info_dir}/related_theorems.md`:

1. **Directly Applicable Theorems**
   - What known theorems could be directly applied to solve (part of) this problem?
   - For each theorem: state it precisely, state ALL its conditions, and explain exactly how it connects to this problem.
   - Flag if any condition might not be met — this is critical.

2. **Closely Related Results**
   - What theorems handle similar or analogous problems?
   - Are there special cases of this problem that are already known results?
   - Are there generalizations of this problem that are known?

3. **Useful Lemmas and Inequalities**
   - What standard lemmas, inequalities, or identities are likely to appear in the proof?
   - (e.g., Cauchy-Schwarz, AM-GM, triangle inequality, pigeonhole, mean value theorem, dominated convergence, etc.)
   - State each one precisely.

4. **Counterexamples to Watch For**
   - What are known counterexamples to plausible-sounding stronger versions of this statement?
   - What hypotheses, if dropped, would make the statement false? Give explicit counterexamples.
   - This helps the proof agent understand which hypotheses are essential.

5. **Most important: paper list with names**
   - What are the link and paper name with short description of the paper that is highly related to this problem?
   - Make sure you have done a very serious effort in finding the related paper.

## Output Requirements

Create the directory `{related_info_dir}/` if it does not exist, and write these files:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `{related_info_dir}/difficulty_evaluation.md` | Difficulty classification (Easy/Medium/Hard) with justification — **always written first** |
| `{related_info_dir}/problem_analysis.md` | Problem classification, key objects, edge cases |
| `{related_info_dir}/related_theorems.md` | Applicable theorems, related results, useful lemmas, counterexamples, paper list with descriptions |

**Note:** The depth of the last two files depends on the difficulty classification from Phase 0. See the branching instructions above.

**Important:** Do NOT write proof strategies, proof plans, or attack plans. Your job is purely to survey the mathematical landscape. The proof search agent will decide how to attack the problem based on your survey.

## Temporary Files

If you need to create temporary files during your research (e.g., scratch computations), save them in:
```
{output_dir}/tmp/
```
Create this directory if it does not exist.

## Critical Instructions

- **Depth over breadth.** A shallow list of 50 theorems is less useful than a deep analysis of the 5 most relevant ones. For each result you cite, explain precisely WHY it matters for THIS problem and HOW it would be used. Same for paper selection.
- **Be precise.** State theorems with full hypotheses. Vague references ("by a standard result...") are useless to the proof agent.
- **Be honest about uncertainty.** If you're not sure whether a theorem applies, say so and explain what would need to be checked.
- **Think adversarially.** Actively look for reasons the problem might be harder than it looks. The proof agent needs to know where the traps are.
- **Focus on actionability.** Everything you write should help the proof agent make better decisions. If a piece of information doesn't help them prove the problem, leave it out.
